# SoundRenderer / WaveSpy

## Objectives

The first objective of the project is to learn and experiment around Web Audio API.

## Features

* Synthesizer : A simple "keyboard" which uses OscillatorNodes to create sound
* Frequency / amplitude representation of a sound from audio HTML element or the embedded synthesizer

## Installation

The application does not require any framework or library for now ; it is implemented in ES6 "vanilla".

To run it, you may use http-server ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server ).

The application does not seem to run correctly on Chrome for the moment, and has not been tested in Internet Explorer or Edge. It should work fine on Firefox.

## Future ?

* Add fancy renderers and improve the spectrum one
* Improve architecture & styling
* Improve synthesizer (adding oscillators, effects, filters if possible...)
